# Logos - Adaptive Axiomatic Regularizer & AxiomaticSelfHealer

## Technical Summary

This repository contains a meta-learning framework for self-correcting AI systems, implementing two core components:

### 1. Adaptive Axiomatic Regularizer (AAR)

The AAR is a monitoring and enforcement system that ensures AI behavior adheres to fundamental axioms:

- **Core Axioms**: Consistency, Completeness, Transparency, Safety, and Fairness
- **Violation Detection**: Identifies axiom violations with contextual analysis
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Dynamically adjusts axiom importance based on feedback
- **Penalty Calculation**: Computes regularization penalties scaled by violation severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- **Learning Mechanism**: Uses gradient-based weight updates with configurable learning rate

**Key Features**:
- Thread-safe violation history tracking using Arc<Mutex<Vec<Violation>>>
- Configurable axiom weights with Safety prioritized at 1.5x by default
- Severity-based multipliers (1x to 8x for Critical violations)
- Weight bounds (0.1-10.0) to prevent extreme adjustments

### 2. AxiomaticSelfHealer

The self-healing system automatically detects and corrects axiom violations using strategic interventions:

**Correction Strategies**:
- **Rollback**: Revert to previous safe state
- **Recompute**: Recalculate results with corrected logic
- **Interpolate**: Fill gaps with estimated values
- **QueryUser**: Escalate to human oversight for critical decisions
- **ApplyDefault**: Use safe fallback values

**Healing Process**:
1. Monitors context for violations using AAR detection
2. Calculates aggregate penalty score
3. Applies appropriate correction strategies when threshold exceeded
4. Records all violations for statistical analysis
5. Returns healed context or error for user intervention

**Statistics Tracking**:
- Total violation count
- Violations categorized by axiom type
- Violations categorized by severity level

## Strategic Value Explanation

### Why This Matters

As AI systems grow more autonomous and complex, ensuring they operate within acceptable ethical and functional boundaries becomes critical. The Logos framework addresses this challenge through:

**1. Proactive Risk Mitigation**
- Prevents harmful outputs before they reach production
- Reduces liability from AI system failures
- Builds trust through transparent violation tracking

**2. Adaptive Intelligence**
- System learns from past violations to improve detection
- Weights adjust automatically based on domain-specific feedback
- No manual rule updates required as context evolves

**3. Autonomous Recovery**
- Minimizes downtime through automatic correction
- Reduces operational costs of manual intervention
- Scales healing strategies across different violation types

**4. Compliance & Governance**
- Provides audit trail of all violations and corrections
- Demonstrates due diligence for regulatory requirements
- Enables data-driven policy refinement

**5. Domain Versatility**
- Axiom framework applies across industries (healthcare, finance, robotics, etc.)
- Correction strategies customizable per use case
- Safety-first design with critical severity handling

### Real-World Applications

- **Healthcare AI**: Ensures diagnostic systems maintain consistency and safety standards
- **Financial Systems**: Prevents unfair bias in credit decisions while maintaining transparency
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Self-corrects safety violations in real-time decision-making
- **Content Moderation**: Balances fairness and safety in automated policy enforcement
- **Scientific Computing**: Validates completeness and consistency of computational results

### Competitive Advantages

1. **Self-Correcting Architecture**: Unlike static rule systems, Logos adapts and heals automatically
2. **Multi-Axiom Framework**: Holistic approach beyond single-dimension safety
3. **Transparent Operations**: Full visibility into violations and corrections for explainable AI
4. **Production-Ready**: Thread-safe, tested, and ready for integration

## Implementation Details

- **Language**: Rust
- **Key Dependencies**: std::collections::HashMap, std::sync::{Arc, Mutex}
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for detection, healing, and penalty calculation
- **File Size**: ~8.77 KB (294 lines)

## Getting Started

```rust
use logos::{AdaptiveAxiomaticRegularizer, AxiomaticSelfHealer};

// Initialize the system
let aar = AdaptiveAxiomaticRegularizer::new();
let mut healer = AxiomaticSelfHealer::new(aar);

// Monitor and heal violations
let result = healer.monitor_and_heal("Your AI system context here");

// Get violation statistics
let stats = healer.get_statistics();
```
